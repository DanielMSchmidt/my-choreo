# My Choreo

Store your dance choreo in the cloud and attach all your notes to them. Also use the test mode to learn them.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Initial testing / deployment pipeline
- [ ] Create & Share always mutable choreos
- [ ] Add mutable notes to steps in the choreo
- [ ] Testing mode (press s q or +) for the choreo
- [ ] Advanced testing mode (song plays and I can press space to the rhythm)
- [ ] Permissions: Share choreos only to be seen, or only to be comments added to
